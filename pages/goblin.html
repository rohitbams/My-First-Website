  <h1 id="header"> The TRUTH about the Goblin of Bavdhan</h1>
 <p> Welcome to the truth about the goblin of bavdhan. You must either  be 
aware of the 
urban legend of the goblin of bavdhan, or you must have clicked here because 
you couldn't resist the mysterious link. 
 </p>

<p>	I am about to <strong>EXPOSE</strong> the truth about the elusive 
	Goblin of Bavdhan using the following pictures!!
</p>

<h2 id="h1"><ins>WHO IS THE GOBLIN CREATURE OF BAVDHAN</ins></h2>

<br>

<br>
<br>

<h2><ins>A creature of humble beginnings</ins> </h2>

<img src="../images/early_days.jpg" height="750" width="380" alt="the first 
mention of the goblin creature of bavdhan">

 <p> Born in a cruel and unjust world, in the tiny country of Kothrud a little 
babe desparately searching for wartmth and love, ended up in the care of 
some well-meaning human beings. These humans took care of the babe, fed it, and 
nurtured it. Little did they know that this baby was actually a power level 1,000,000 XP 
<strong><ins>OVER POWERED BEAST!</ins></strong>!!!

<br>

However, realising what they had signed up for, they put out a poster, the 
first ever mention of the <strong>GOBLIN CREATURE</strong>, however it was 
named as <strong>Draco</strong>, named after the fabled dark wizard of the 
olden times. </p>

<h2><ins>The Goblin finds his way to the country of Bavdhan</ins></h2>

<img src="../images/sleeping1.jpg" height="300" width="500" alt="the little 
goblin sleeping">
<p> Seen here sleeping like an angel, one would be easily fooled into thinking 
that this creature could do no harm... However one would be 
<strong><em><ins>WRONG!!!</ins></em></strong>
<br>
Remember how we wrote that the babe was born with 1,000,000 XP? Well, at 10 
weeks old as seen here in this picture, his power level had increased to 
<ins><strong>10,000,000 XP!!</strong></ins> 
<br>
The baby goblin found his way into the country of Bavdhan in search of food 
and shelter. He had heard that the country of Bavdhan was a rich and fertile 
land, which indicated an abundance of prey to him.
<br> He quickly form lair of his own, that the local population named "Sha'gn 
N'isrg" which in their language meant "The belly of the beast".
</p>

</p>

<h2>The Goblin's Growth</h2>
<p>
As time went by, the Goblin soon found a cult following in the fearful locale 
of Bavdhan. Soon he recruited two young devoted human followers as his trusted 
retainers. These two followers were feared as well, for they had earned the 
Goblin's 
favours. They were called "Che ley" in the local tongue. They provided the 
Goblin much required nurturing for him to assume his full power.
</p>

<h2>His Ears begin to grow</h2>
<p> As ancient folklore goes, the true powers of the Goblin are his formidable 
senses. One of his strongest senses is his hearing, and as you can see in this 
terrifying picture, the baby goblin's ears have begun to grow.
</p>

<h2>The terror begins to spread</h2>

<p> Across the whole entire country of Bavdhan, and even it's neighbouring 
countries of Kothrud, and Pashan, and as far as Model colony, the news of the 
Goblin Creature of Bavdhan brought terror with it. But this also created 
excitement in the adventurers who believed they could Ã¸
capture this formidable 
foe and win hearts and riches. However, they were sorely mistaken. One of the 
adventurers who had a highly sophiticated magical ability to produce physical 
copies of the scenery he viewed, ventured into Sha'gn Ni'srg. He was never 
seen again, however a picture was found a few yards outside of the lair.
<br>
This was the picture <ins>(viewer discretion advised)</ins>:

<h2>Questions to GOD</h2>
<p>
<strong> HOW COULD YOU??! HOW COULD YOU BRING SUCH A CREATURE INTO 
EXISTENCE?!!?? WHY, LORD, WHY!!!???</strong>
</p>

Is he powering up? His magical abilities are beyond imagination!</p>

<h2> The Goblin grows bolder </h2>

<p> Realising that there is no other creature on this godforsaken earth that 
could come close to defeating him, our goblin master grows bolder. Here he is 
seen wearing his prey, the fearsome Rat Toy, an already impressive beast, as a 
hat after defeating him.
</p>

prey as hat">


<h2> The Chosen one </h2>
<p> As his woefully misled cult grew bigger, his followers started spreading 
lies about 
the reason for existence. They called him "The Chosen One", creating posters of 
him 
being shown basking in the Light of Heaven.

<h2>Exanding his territory, new job, new life</h2>

<p> The Goblin had grown bored of his lair, and wanted to venture beyond his 
territory. At this point, the entire country of Bavdhan, Kothrud, Shivajinagar, 
and Pipmpri Chinchwad were under his control. The citizens had accepted him as 
their new God, and would pray to him and gift tributes to him in the form of 
treats. But, the Goblin King was not satisfied. He took it upon himself to find 
new grounds, and set forth on his voyage to the continent of Thane. The people 
of Thane had no idea that their entire way of life was about to change forever.
<br>

However, having just left a life as an immortal God behind, the Goblin Kind 
decided that he would keep his power level which was now 
<strong><ins>1,000,000,000,000 XP</ins></strong> hidden. The 
Goblin King quickly found a new lair, and settled in. He found the setting 
tolerable. He assumed a secret identity and started a job as a singer at the 
local pub. He made a humble living this way. Following are a few pictures of 
him 
singing at a local pub.
</p>

<br>

<h2>The New Lair, and a new secret job</h2>

<p>
While the Goblin King found his new place quite tolerable, he felt like he was 
missing something. He tried cleaning his apartment, and rearranging the 
furniture, of which there was only the Cat Tree. This felt good to him.
<br>

<br>
However, noticing the rampant crime in the city of Kolshet, he decided he must 
do something about it. The Goblin King believed in 'ACAB' which could mean one 
of two things- either "All Cats Are Beautiful" or "All Cops Are Bastards". 
We may never know the full truth. But he took it upon himself to don the 
metaphorical cape and cowl and fight the increasing crime in his city. This was 
the beginning of his new secret job- a super hero goblin. With his power level, 
no criminal would be a challenge for our Goblin King. However, there was one 
challenge that even he struggled with. That was the reason crime happened. He 
studied hard and read many books, but he couldn't answer this question. So he 
did what he did best, which is <strong>DEFEAT ALL FOES!!!!</strong>

<br>
<strong><em><ins>He became a super hero and took out criminals in the city.

</p>

<h2>This is not even his FINAL FORM</h2>

<p> Is there anything more to say? Look at the sheer <strong>ENERGY</strong> 
radiating out of body! This form was seen when some crazy criminal took sweaty 
shirts 
and <em>threw</em> them in the washing machine!

<p>Here he can be seen in his aerodynamic form </p>

<h2>The Downfall of the Hero Goblin</h2>

<p> His hero days were going great, however he was a sleepy boy. As you know, 
most of his hero activities ran at the nightly hours when the criminal element 
was most active. The Goblin King, as much as he wanted to protect his city from 
the clutches of crime, couldn't negelct his good sleeping habits, and chose to 
focus on improving his sleep schedule. Sleepy King.

<h2>The Conclusion</h2>

<p>Such is the story of the Goblin Creature of Bavdhan. Although he now lives 
and works in Kolshet, he is still referred to as the Goblin Creature of 
Bavhdan. For even today, the citizens of Bavdhan pray to their Goblin God 
everyday.

<p>
Besides singing at a local pub, he also focusses on his health and fitness and 
works out 4 times in a week. Here he is seen doing complex core exercises.

<p>
This was the tale of the Goblin Creature, the Goblin King, Hero Goblin, call 
him what you will, but you cannot deny that is a Goblin. Now I bid you farewell 
with the last few images of this Great Creature.
